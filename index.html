        <h1 class="welcome">Why an online coding platform?</h1>
        <p>
          As technology continues to advance, coding has become an essential
          skill in many industries. Our student community website recognizes
          this and aims to equip our members with the necessary skills to thrive
          in the digital age. Offering an online coding platform that allows
          students to practice programming in popular languages such as C++, C,
          Python, and Java provides them with the opportunity to develop their
          skills and build their confidence.
          <br /><br />
          In addition, our coding forum allows students to share their
          knowledge, collaborate on projects, and receive feedback from their
          peers. We believe that our online coding platform and forum provide an
          interactive and engaging learning experience that will benefit our
          student community in their future careers.
